# 📈 Product Demand Forecasting with ARIMA

This project demonstrates how to forecast product demand using synthetic retail sales data and the ARIMA time series model.

## 🔍 Overview
Retailers often need to anticipate future demand to optimize inventory and pricing strategies. This notebook simulates monthly sales data and applies ARIMA modeling to predict future demand.

## 📊 Features
- Synthetic time series data generation
- Trend and seasonality visualization
- ARIMA model training and forecasting
- Forecast vs. actual comparison
- Evaluation using MAE and RMSE

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas

- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Statsmodels (ARIMA)
- Scikit-learn (metrics)

## 📁 Files
- `product_demand_forecasting.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with full analysis
- `product_demand_forecasting.zip`: Compressed version for easy sharing

## 📈 Results
The ARIMA model achieved:
- **MAE**: ~X.XX
- **RMSE**: ~X.XX

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis
